    "For my final COGS 18 project, I decided to recreate the cootie catcher (aka fortune teller) game through Python code. In the beginning, the game is introduced and three categories are presented. The player can either choose to receive a fortune, words of encouragement, or be given a fun task to do. Afterwards, the player is asked to select a color, select a number, and then is given a message according to the category that was chosen. "

In order to do this, I had to figure out how to create buttons with appropriate outputs using ipywidgets, which is something that I had never done before. I also created three categories that the player could choose from, instead of just having fortunes returned to the player. "
